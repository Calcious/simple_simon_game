DESCRIPTION:

Simple Simon is a game whereby the computer selects a specified pattern of squares to which the user is prompted to repeat.  The game begins with a single random selection of one of the four squares and proceeds to build off of that selection by one additional random square each round.  Between each round, the user is expected to memorize the computer's selection and input the pattern by selecting the specified squares with the mouse.  The game continues until the user fails to repeat the computer's pattern exactly.
